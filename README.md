# Solid Contacts

Client-client specifications of contacts data for people and organizations

## Example
 The Solid Project has an [address book](https://solidproject.solidcommunity.net/Solid%20Project%20Contacts/index.ttl#this) .. that has groups like the Solid Team in it.  If you look at the "Sub Projects" group that includes the organization SolidOS .. click on that and you should eb able to find also under that project's stuff in its profile another address book.
